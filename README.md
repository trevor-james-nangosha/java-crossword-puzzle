# Crossword puzzle mini-project

This mini-project aims to create an abstraction for representing a crossword puzzle in code
Although the puzzle is currently hard coded into the program, it provides a basic representation of the puzzle  
The questions and the solutions are in the meantime stored in two separate files, for simplicity.

Another important thing to point out is that I have not yet found a way to avoid hard-coding the puzzle(will sometime later), but right now each puzzle object has an **image** variable.

This image is meant to mirror the real-life puzzle that we are trying to implement.
For this program, this is the puzzle we are trying to implement:

Also, the program serves as a good introduction to someone who wants to try out Java features like `generics`, `OOP`, `inheritance` and all that cool stuff that Java has to offer.
